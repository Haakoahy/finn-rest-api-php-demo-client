==============================

## PHP sample code for clients getting started with the FINN REST API

It demonstrates how to do a search for "Boliger til salgs" and parse the result

__This demo aims to get you started, it comes with absolutely NO GUARANTEE! As an API-client you are responsible of your client-side code__

## Getting started:
1. Copy the _/config/client.ini.template_  file into another _client.ini_ file:


    cp /samples/config/client.ini.template /samples/config/client.ini


2. Enter your private API-credentials in client.ini


3. Take a look:


    php /samples/realestate/homes/search.php

And off you go!
